## Abstract
Patterns  describe a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution million times over, wihtout ever doing it in the same way twice[1].

Design patters are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general problem in a particular context.
